Here's the documentation for [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html#geography-in-tidycensus-1)

Start with a very basic request: population by county
```{r}
county_pop <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = "B01001_001", 
              state = "MO", 
              year = 2019)

county_pop_acs1 <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = "B01001_001", 
              state = "MO", 
              year = 2019,
              survey = "acs1")
```

Now by place (and you can rename the variable): 
```{r}
place_pop <- get_acs(geography = "place", 
              variables = c(population="B01001_001"), 
              state = "MO", 
              year = 2019)
```

Search for variables:
```{r}
acs2019_var <- load_variables(2019, "acs5", cache=TRUE)

```
